## Module 03 - Branching Programs
[back to outline](../../outline.html)
### Summary
This module introduces branching, the ways in which your program can react to conditions and do different things in different situations.  

**Note to students familar with C++** - even if you think you know branching well, go through this carefully - python has different conditional structures than C-based langauges, and uses indentation differently!

This module is also the first module where a set of specific excercises are presented.  Do these yourself before looking at the solution code and videos
