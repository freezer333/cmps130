## Programming Exercise 10 - Computing the Square Root of x
Computing the square root of a number is a well studied mathematical problem, and there are several ways of doing so.  In this problem, we'll create three solutions, each one more efficient then the last.  This is an important concept in computing - one which we'll talk more about as the course continues - in that often there are many ways to get the "right" answer.  Often, as a computer scientist, you need to determine not only a way of getting the right answer, but also a way to do it in as few steps as possible.

**Required Reading**: These solutions are based on the textbook's description of three numerical methods.  Please read these carefully first so you understand how the techniques work.

- Technique #1:  Exhaustive Enumeration
- Technique #2:  Bisection
- Technique #3:  Newton-Raphson
