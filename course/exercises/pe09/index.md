## Programming Exercise 9 - Approximating PI
PI can be estimated by computing an infinite series…

<pre style="font-size:14pt">
PI = 4 * ( 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 -1/11 +…)
</pre>

- Write a program to estimate PI…
- How long does it take to get to 3.14159?


###Guidelines
- Do the top half first (increasing order)
- Do the second half as a completely separate loop
- Remember, you’ll print out “n” number of stars on a line the same way whether you are doing the top half or bottom half!
