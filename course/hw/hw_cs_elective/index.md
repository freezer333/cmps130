If you are a Computer Science major wishing to count this course as one of your seven electives, you are required to complete the following additional assignment before the last day of the class.  As a computer science major, you already know C and C++ well (perhaps C++ more than C).  In this assignment you will implement a well known algorithm in computer science commonly used in genetics research in both Python and C++.  You will also evaluate the two, for both runtime efficiency and ease of programming.  The purpose of this assignment is for you to better understand the similarities, differences, and relative strengths of Python and C++ on a common problem.

## The Algorithm

This is an O(N<sup>2</sup>) algorithm, and is extremely resource intensive.  Interestingly, computer scientists have been debating for decades whether there exists a better (more efficient) algorithm for this type of problem.  Coincidentally, it has [recently been proven to be optimal](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/algorithm-genome-best-possible-0610)!
## Input 
Read from two text files, two genomic sequences

## Implementation in C++

## Implementation in Python

## Analysis
### Runtime and memory efficiency
### Programming experience
